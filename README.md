### [Hello there, my name is Sean Wong][website] ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Los Angelesâ€“based (open to relocating) software engineer with a B.S. in Human Biology from UC San Diego and two years in medical school who pivoted to code. After automating research workflows with FlyClicker in Python, I deepened my full-stack skills at HackReactorâ€™s bootcampâ€”building CupQuestâ€™s social features with React, Express, and Socket.io. Today, Iâ€™m mastering Swift/UIKit through RunQuest, driven by a passion for clean, efficient code and a growth mindset.
